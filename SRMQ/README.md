# SRMQ - Simple Rabbit MQ

## Just Works
After working with several message providers, such as Azure message queues, or ActiveMQ, I came to like RabbitMQ more and more. One of the things I noticed when moving into the world of dotnetcore is that there wasn't any good documentation on how to actually use RMQ. 

One of the worst things I found was RMQ's own C# tutorials. If you follow their getting started guide and try to write something in production, you'll never get a working system, as they tend to wrap all of your clients in using statements. What I've written is a simple set of classes to facilitate you getting your platform off the ground. 

I will also provide a sample project that will allow you to reflect all of your classes into existance at once, requiring practically no additional work!
